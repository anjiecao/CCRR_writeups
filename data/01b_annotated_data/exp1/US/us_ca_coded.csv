SS1610329585116,CA,"Kelly is afraid of riding the bicycle likely because she is not comfortable riding the bicycle/has not practiced enough to feel confident in her ability to ride the bicycle without falling or getting hurt. The bicycle is not an inherently dangerous thing to play on, and Kelly is not a ""scared person"" or ""the kind of person who gets scared""-- being scared is not a personality trait, but an emotion that comes and goes, and is a natural response that Kelly has to the given situation (lack of experience and lack of presence of someone who is experience to help guide her in this moment). Kelly is afraid of getting hurt/falling. Likely knowing that she doesn't have enough experience to feel comfortable or trust herself to ride safely, Kelly decides it's safest for her not to ride the bike, which is probably an excellent decision given that she is not wearing a helmet or any other protective gear anyways (even if she was comfortable riding a bike, she knows she probably shouldn't given that she's not wearing a helmet). Thus, it is also likely that Kelly is not afraid to ride the bike with a helmet, but is afraid to without, which is also a fear natural response. ",1,Kelly,1,3,3,
