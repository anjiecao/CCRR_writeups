We did not observe cross-cultural differences in the majority of the tasks we tested. The only exceptions were in picture description and our exploratory measure of reasoning performance (Raven's Matrices). Many of our tasks did not have a manipulation check and could yield null results simply by virtue of inattention. However, the results of the Raven's task (and the Ebbinghaus Illusion) suggest that participants were engaged in our tasks and performed at a high objective level. Further, in addition to minor methodological changes that we made,  interpretation of our failures to replicate individual tasks in many cases could be due to (1) differences in administration (online vs. in-person), (2) differences in participant recruitment (e.g., university pool vs. snowball recruitment), (3) differences in target age (adults vs. children), and (4) differences in sample (e.g. Japanese vs. Chinese adults in the East Asian group). Nevertheless, our failure to find robust Western vs. East Asian cultural differences was dispiriting. 

We designed Experiment 2 to extend Experiment 1 by recruiting a different sample and identifying followup or replacement tasks that we hoped would yield a broader set of cross-cultural differences.
