Overall, Experiment 2 was more successful than Experiment 1, with more cultural differences found between the U.S. and Chinese participants. The success can be attributed to the inclusion of the successful tasks from Experiment 1 (e.g. Free Description and Ravens Progressive Matrices), and the exclusion of tasks designed for young children (e.g. Child Causal Attribution, Horizon Collage).
