Overall, Experiment 2 was more successful than Experiment 1 in documenting cross-cultural differences between participants in the US and China. This success can be attributed to the inclusion of the successful tasks from Experiment 1 (e.g., Free Description and Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices), and the exclusion of tasks designed for young children (e.g., Child Causal Attribution, Horizon Collage).
